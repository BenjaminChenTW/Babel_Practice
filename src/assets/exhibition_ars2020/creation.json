Players will play the leading role of Jung, a quacksalver treating all kinds of incurable diseases via killing nightmares transformed from subconsciousness by slipping into people’s consciousness. At this time, he will slip into the consciousness of a female opera singer, who became a vegetable for some reason, to step by step piece up the key to her recovery and the conspiracy deeply hidden behind via the found clues.",

The story of this game happens in a high-altitude broad-leaved forest where clouded leopards live in, a middle-altitude cloud forest in Anma Mountain where black bears live in, and a low-altitude rice field where leopard cats live in. Via the game-like digital teaching aid for ecological simulation on the mobile device, students can simulate the ecology of the mountain areas in Taiwan, observing the interactive relationship between the environment and animals. By simulating the circumstances in the game, explorative learning is expected to be effectively integrated into scientific courses, transforming the main learning method of “learning the existing knowledge” into the immersive learning of “creating knowledge” that emphasizes on practice and solution finding. This game-like digital teaching aid system for biology courses will increase learning capability, motive as well as diversity.\n",

However, even today of the 21st century, the issues of women's equality are still chained by traditional customs or religious cultures in many regions and countries, and even been regarded as heterodox and banned on discussion and participation. By this short animation “The Empress,” the awakening of women’s awareness of autonomy is conveyed via the feudal society background of the patriarchalism reigning supreme in the story, expecting that the audience can understand the women striving for freedom and rights and that we should provide more respect, empathy and tolerance. On the production and graphic technology, our three team members used specialized drawing software, such as Photoshop and Illustrator, to design roles and scenes.

Nevertheless, in the fragments of events, the frames fall into the status sometimes clear and sometimes blurred. In the end, the leading role jumps hard into the swimming pool after understanding the form of frames… As the imagery, “water” symbolizes the contradictory phenomenon that people get along with each other by sometimes clear and sometimes blurred relationships due to different standpoints.

With sensors, it detects dancers’ motion data while stretching their bodies, immediately transforms these data into images by programs, and then projects images onto veils, with dancers’ performance on the spot. Because of the characteristic of veils, the audience can watch dancers’ performance with the sight of images. It allows dancers to reach beyond where their bodies could, making the dance and images blend better and strengthening the power of the dance. Although it is on the basis of dance, the audience can still simply move their limbs (e.g. opening arms) to interact with the projected images. Technically, the depth and tracking camera RealSense is used to sense dancers’ motion ranges and positions, and the gyroscope MPU-6050 is used to retrieve dancers’ motions and spins. The sensed values will be transformed into images.",

Looking back at the traditional families in the past, women always knitted clothes needle by needle and thread by thread for their family members, which not only made clothes solider and prettier but also left the temperature of hand-embroidering. However, in modern times, the emergence of machine embroidery made traditional embroidery gradually be replaced by machines, and this ability also turned into traditional skill from housework. Therefore, via an embroidery hoop device projected in the air, combined with traditional room design of window paper-cuts, the audience is expected to experience more in the interactive process, not only experiencing the embroidering process with a needle but also discovering where embroidery is really interesting.",

Aluminum cans are strung as fish, supported by recycled materials and driven by software, expecting to make people care about the ocean through the theme presented by the media. The creation is titled “Fish’s Breathing.” Breathing is an essential element for creatures to maintain their lives. Water pipes allow Coke to flow through fish’s body, which symbolizes nutrition transportation, i.e. breathing. This creation conveys that fish have gradually been corroded by man-made trash, evolving into different species, which is to remind humans to cherish ocean resources and pay attention to environmental protection.",

Humans consider ourselves the dominant of the world and forget the nature of the world. “Water” nourishes every life, which is low-keyed and holy. But humans manipulate and occupy it as if we have controlled everything. Actually, what is manipulated by humans is merely a small part of this world. After this small part accumulates and reaches the physical limit of the environment, the recovery process will be more complicated than that in the beginning. It will waste money and manpower and even endanger both humans and the environment. In this creation, keyboard MIDI signals are received from Processing and then sent to Arduino via Firmata channels; programs are also coded in Arduino to control solenoid valves so as to control the media’s passing in and out.",

We choose the images of Einstein and Marilyn Monroe, who are both famous crazy icon in history, to let these two geniuses “meet” in the virtual space while they are combined in one in reality. From multiple angles of view, audience can only see the complete face of Einstein or Marilyn Monroe when they are standing at the zero-degree angle of a particular side, the slightest deviation (even -1 or +1 degree of angle) will affect the clearness of images. Usually, truth cannot be seen until a particular moment, this very moment is like the fact that a particular data can only represent a particular point in virtual world, we can only see the right image while standing at the zero point.

In the era of AI, our concept is to create an AI system that showcases its perception, then we reveal the its primality and ingenuity in the computing process by installation art. We built the convolutional neural network (ConvNet, or CNN), which is a state-of-art AI model, and specializes in visual recognition and image generation. First, we designed and trained ConvNets that can analyze images and transform their local perception layer-by-layer to the corresponding Chinese pictograms. Then, a set of installation art pieces that transforms the digital structure of CNN to an analog representation is constructed to visualize the algorithmic and structural details of ConvNets, which emphasizes neural activations and model weights. Unlike most existing AI artworks created to demonstrate the power of AI, or to show the reflection on the influence of AI to human society, we expect this work would help people have a better understanding of the inside architecture of the modern AI system, and appreciate the beauty of its complexity.",
