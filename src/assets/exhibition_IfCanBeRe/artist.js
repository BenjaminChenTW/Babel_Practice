    description: `""Benedict是一位多方位的藝術創作者與研究者。他以往的作品涵蓋東方哲學與社會心理學。這次的創作中、Benedict特別與阿嬤和爸爸一起創作、嘗試三代同堂的計畫。過程中、他重新審視自己家族的複雜關係與歷史、以此重新去收集資料和建檔。Benedict歷來展覽地區包含倫敦、東京、京都、巴塞隆納、羅馬、新加坡、等地區的美術館與畫廊。

Benedict Yu is a multi-disciplinary art practitioner and researcher. His previous works explore Eastern philosophy and social psychology. This time during his practices, Benedict creates his works especially with his grandma and his dad, a cross-generation plan. During the process, he re-examines his family’s complicated history by collecting datas and  archiving them. His works and research have been shown internationally in the galleries and museums of London, Tokyo, Kyoto, Barcelona, Rome, Singapore, and Taiwan.
